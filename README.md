# IntanToNWB
Convert Intan (rhd or rhs) files to NWB file format

To run this example, either download the 8 files:
1. IntanToNWB.ipynb
2. ConverterUI.py
3. ConvertIntanToNWB.py
4. ProcessData.py
5. ReadIntanData.py
6. ReadIntanHeader.py
7. SetupResources.py
8. WriteNWB.py

to the same directory and open them with Jupyter Notebook on your own machine (Jupyter must already be installed), or click the Binder link below to run it in a remote Docker container.

This notebook depends on PyNWB, a Python NWB package that provides the HDF5 interface used for writing to NWB format. This notebook was written using version 2.0.0 of PyNWB.
